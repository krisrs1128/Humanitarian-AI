### Purpose

This reading group serves several complementary purposes,
* Educate ourselves about the state of machine learning applications in the social good space.
* Discover unifying themes, and clarify humanitarian AI research problems aligned with Milaâ€™s strengths.
* Create a space to coordinate and evaluate potential collaborations between Mila people and those working directly on problems of social relevance.

Reflecting these goals, the format for meetings will vary,
 * Discussions of specific papers related to humanitarian AI.
 * Summaries of historical work in general application areas (e.g., crisis response or sustainability).
 * Descriptions of projects from potential collaborators, along with QA.
